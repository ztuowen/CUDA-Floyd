Experiment for HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
	Washall's algorithms

===========================    Structure    ===========================

	input		- holds the generated input file
	sequential	- holds the CPU implementation
		washall-cpu		- executable of the CPU implementation
			washall-cpu [output.txt] [input.txt]
	native		- holds the native(CUDA) implementation
		washall-cuda	- executable of the CUDA implementation
			washall-cuda [output.txt] [input.txt]
	scripts		- scripts used in makefiles & test
	testgen		- testfile generator
		washall-test	- executable of the test file generator
			washall-test [N] (testfile)

===========================     Makefile    ===========================
	
makefile contains several target:
	all		: make everything
	clean	: clean all the executables as well as *.o s generated
	run		: run the two implementations, regenerate testfile
	exe		: run the two implementations, does not regenerate testfile
	diff	: compare the results of two implementations
	
	testfile	: generate a test file with 2048 nodes, that is a matrix with size 2048x2048
	washall-test: test generator
	washall-cuda: native implementation
	washall-cpu : sequential implementation on the cpu
	
washall-cuda uses the blocked implementation with float

===========================Compile & Execute===========================

1. First goto the root directory (project) and run:

	make
		or
	make all
	
	to make everything

2. Run:

	make run
	
	Executes washall-cuda as well as washall-cpu.
	input will be generated with 2048 nodes and the file is located in the input directory named matrix.txt.
	output will be put to the output directory with cudamatrix.txt for washall-cuda and cpumatrix.txt for washall-cpu 
	WARNING: test file will be remake whenever you type this.

2. To compare the result, type and enter:
	
	make diff
	
	if you have already run the first step this should provide you with a result stating wether the two output files differ.
	
===========================  Compile Only   ===========================

To compile everything just run:

	make all
		or
	make
	
To compile specific program:

	make washall-test
		for test file generator
	make washall-cuda
		or
	make washall-cpu
	
To make a testfile

	make testfile
		will produce one with the size specified in the makefile (default 2048)
	scripts/generate-testfile.sh [[Number of nodes]]
		will produce one with arbitrary size
	
To run the test without overwriten customized testfile
	
	make exe
	
========================= Changing Input size =========================

Follow the steps above or change the makefile

	vim makefile
	
	find the first line:
		TESTSIZE=2048
	use i or R to change it to any number you want(preferably smaller than 17408, largest I've ever tested, that is over 2GB in memory!)

============================ Other scripts ============================

scripts/time.sh [[program]]
	
	This script times the program with input size from 1024 to 17408 at step length 1024
	the script will stop when ever the average execution time(5 times) execeed one minute
	the results is writen to [[program]].log
	for example, run:
	
		scripts/time.sh native/washall-cuda
		
	The scripts will start running automatically, and prints its result to the log file:
		
		native/washall-cuda.log:
			1024 10.5695
			2048 65.5086
			...
			...
			...
			16384 23661.6
			17408 28533.8
